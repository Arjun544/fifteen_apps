# Countdown Timer
### Tier: 1-Beginner
We all have important events we look forward to in life, birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays to name a few. Wouldn’t it be nice to have an app that counts down the months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds to an event? Countdown Timer is just that app!
The objective of Countdown Timer is to provide a continuously decrementing display of the he months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds to a user entered event.

### Constraints
Use only builtin language functions for your calculations rather than relying on a library or package. This assumes, of course, that the language of your choice has adequate date and time manipulation functions built in.
You may not use any code generators. You should develop your own original implementation.

### Features
User can pick a date & time for a event to start.  
User can enter name of event to start.  
User can see how much left in completing of event.  
User can see a warning message if the event name is blank.  
User can see a warning message if the event date or time are incorrectly entered.  
User can click on the ‘Start’ button to see the countdown timer start displaying the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the event takes place.  
User can see the elements in the countdown timer automatically decrement. For example, when the remaining seconds count reaches 0 the remaining minutes count will decrement by 1 and the seconds will start to countdown from 59. This progression must take place from seconds all the way up to the remaining days position in countdown display.
